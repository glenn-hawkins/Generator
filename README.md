I began this project to create an easy method for creating custom kanji flashcards or vocabulary worksheets. The web app allows for easy inputting and sorting of new vocabulary and production of several formats of output: kanji flashcards, vocabulary list, and vocabulary quiz.

This project is incomplete due to several factors including the unfortunate destruction of some files: generator.css, request.js, and select.js. When they are rebuilt, I will reupload them. In addition, the project does not use best practices for centralizing mysql server details. If the project is developed further, this will be fixed.

I intend to build a mobile version of the app that will allow for easy use of the database with mobile devices.

All code and graphics were created completely by me.
